# Lunar Phase üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: SNARC


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Nemuel Sam Jerry - College of Engineering Chengannur
- Member 2: Niranjan K - College of Engineering Chengannur

### Project Description
We take a date as an input from the user and display the phase of the moon on that particular date using the mathematical algorithms involving the lunar cycle.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
People trying to find the phase of the moon in the far future and as well as in the past.For example trying to find the phase of the moon in 1801 or 2999.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An algorithm that calculates the phase of the moon using a reference new moon date and lunarcycle length.

## Technical Details
